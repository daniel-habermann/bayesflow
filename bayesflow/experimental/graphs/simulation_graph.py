class SimulationGraph(nx.DiGraph):
    """
    Directed acyclic graph defining a simulation composed of sampling nodes.
    Created and mutated internally when building a `GraphicalSimulator`.

    A `SimulationGraph` is used to infer a factorization of the joint posterior
    in two stages: First, the graph is expanded into an `ExpandedGraph`.
    This is necessary to determine if variables from a node can be estimated
    group-wise (enabling amortization over groups).

    Second, an inversion algorithm is applied to the `ExpandedGraph` to produce
    an `InvertedGraph`, which served as an input to the `GraphicalApproximator`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    meta_fn : Callable[[], dict[str, Any]] | None
        Function returning a dict of meta data.
        This meta data can be used to dynamically vary the number of sampling repetitions (`reps`)
        for nodes added via `add_node`.
